**Where to Find Data**

The U.K. is currently implementing a new Open Data Policy, as outlined in the [Managing Information as an Asset](http:/project-open-data.github.io) memorandum. On November, 9, 2013 you can access all public federal government data at data.gov, and government data owned/maintained by specific federal agencies by going to *agency.gov*/data.json. Until then, much, but not all, public government data will be available at these locations, described using the metadata below.

Agencies may integrate an existing system for maintaining unique identifiers or enter arbitrary characters for this field. However, each identifier must be unique across the agency’s catalog and remain fixed. Characters should be alphanumeric.
Public Access Level  | accessLevel  | Yes  | (1,1) |  The degree to which this dataset could be made publicly-available, regardless of whether it has been made available.

Data Dictionary | dataDictionary  | If applicable  |(1,1) | URL to the data dictionary for the dataset or API. Note that documentation other than a Data Dictionary can be referenced using Related Documents as shown in the expanded fields.   |   URL
Download URL | accessURL  | If applicable  |  (1,1) |  URL providing direct access to the downloadable distribution of a dataset. |   This must be the direct download URL. Use **landingPage** for landing or disambiguation pages, or **references** for documentation pages.
API Endpoint |  webService |  If applicable | (1,)  | Endpoint of web service to access dataset.  |   This field will serve to delineate the web services offered by an agency and will be used to aggregate cross-government API catalogs.

For example, if the download file is a ZIP containing a CSV, the entry here is “ZIP”.
License   | license  |  If applicable | (0,1)  | The license dataset or API is published with.  |   
Spatial Coverage | spatial  | If applicable  | (0,1)  | The range of spatial applicability of a dataset. Could include a spatial region like a bounding box or a named place.  |   This field should contain one of the following types of content: (1) a bounding coordinate box for the dataset represented in latitude / longitude pairs where the coordinates are specified in decimal degrees and in the order of: minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude, maximum latitude; (2) a latitude / longitude pair (in decimal degrees) representing a point where the dataset is relevant; (3) a geographic feature expressed in Geography Markup Language using the Simple Features Profile; or (4) a geographic feature from the GeoNames database.
Temporal Coverage | temporal   | If applicable  | (0,1)  |  The range of temporal applicability of a dataset (i.e., a start and end date of applicability for the data). |   This field should contain an interval of time defined by start and end dates. Dates should be formatted as pairs of {start date, end date} in the format YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss using 24 hour clock time notation (e.g., 2011-02-14 12:00:00, 2013-02-14 12:00:00).
Release Date    | issued  | No  | (0,1)  | Date of formal issuance.  |    Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
Frequency of Update  | accrualPeriodicity  |  No | (0,1)  |  Frequency with which dataset is published. |   Must be one of the following: hourly, daily, weekly, yearly, other
Language    | language  | No  | (0,n)  | The language of the dataset.  | string
Granularity    | granularity  | No  | (0,1)   | Level of granularity of the dataset.  |    Typically geographical or temporal.
Data Quality    | dataQuality | No  | (0,1)  |  Whether the dataset meets the agency’s Information Quality Guidelines. | Boolean (true/false)    
Category    | theme  |  No |  (0,n) |  Main thematic category of the dataset. |   Comma-separated values
Documentation | references  | No  | (0,n)  | Related documents such as technical information about a dataset, developer documentation, etc.  |   Comma-separated URLs
Size    | size  | No  | (0,1)  | The size of the downloadable dataset.  |   Sizes should be formatted as (e.g.), 52kb, 140mb, 2gb.
Homepage URL    |  landingPage |  No |(0,1) |  Alternative landing page used to redirect user to a contextual, Agency-hosted “homepage” for the Dataset or API when selecting this resource from the Data.gov user interface. |  URL; This field is not intended for an agency’s homepage (e.g. www.agency.gov), but rather if a dataset has a human-friendly hub or landing page that users should be directed to for all resources tied to the dataset. This allows agencies to better specify what a visitor receives after selecting one of the agency’s datasets on Data.gov or in third-party mashups.
